# Image_Retrieval
Computer Vision Capstone Project 20222\
In this project, we build an efficient and accurate retrieval system of fashion products, utilizing Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques.\
**Image reranking**: \
**Object Detection** : We use YOLOv5 to detect fashion items in an image so that consumers can choose the item they desire to get similar images. The code for object detection training and demo can be found in https://github.com/PhamVuHuyenTrang/Image_Retrieval/tree/main/Object_Detection.
